# FileSystem description
„FileSystem” – is implementation of file system that uses drive mapping. The whole disc is a file, where you can put another files. The disc mapping implementation allocate space automatically. 

To see how it works, you can use "test.sh" file. To run it use _"chmod +x test.s"_ and then _"./test.sh"_
